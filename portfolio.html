				<h1>Project Draw By Typing (1.1.9): Using python and 
					Visual Studio code, my group created a program which 
					interacted with users to create different drawings. 
					Users can select one of four models: a car, an apple, 
					a flower, or a snowman. Additionally, based on the model 
					selection users are prompted to pick their desired colors 
					that will be incorporated into their drawing. Lastly, 
					the program executes the drawing and adds an animation 
					in the background(i.e. the car model will have a sun pass
					by to give the illusion of movement as seen above).</h1>

				<h1>Project Turtle Racing (1.2.5): Our group used 
					Visual Studio code and python, to create a user interactive game complete with a timer, scoring functionality, and keyboard input. The game we made consists of a custom designed 2D map with trees, rocks, coins, and a road. We incorporated random generation of coins around the map which the player has to drive towards with the arrow keys and 'collect'. The objective of the game is to collect the highest number of coins within one minute.</h1>
